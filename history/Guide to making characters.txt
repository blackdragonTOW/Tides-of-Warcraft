How to make characters for speed and ease of editing:

Files are ordered by "regions", which can be defined as either WoW regions or de-jure kingdoms/empires (so Quel'Thalas might make more sense than splitting it into three). Reserve the numbers for that file in its name.

When making characters, comment where they belong so:

#Kingdom of Quel'Thalas
Anasterian Sunstrider
(whatever info is needed)
father = X # Please note down the name of who it is

If the character will appear as a child or baby in multiple bookmarks, make sure any traits are given through history commands in specific dates.

Only canon characters need pre-defined traits and stats.
