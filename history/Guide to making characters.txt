How to make characters for speed and ease of editing:

Files are ordered by race. Reserve the numbers for that file in its name.

Whenever a character is referenced within another, such as specifiying parents or spouses, please place a comment saying who that character is. This also extends to title history files for ease of editing.

If the character will appear as a child or baby in multiple bookmarks, make sure any traits are given through history commands in specific dates.

Only canon characters need pre-defined traits and stats.
