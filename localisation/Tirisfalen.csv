EVTTITLETIRIS.1;Demons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.1;There have been reports of strange creatures, identified as demons by some of the elves residing in the city, in various locations close to Dalaran. Perhaps you should contact Quel'Thalas about this issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.1a;We can deal with it on our own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.1b;Let's ask the elves for help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.2;A host of demons from beyond the world has appeared near Dalaran and marches for the city, attracted by the rampant use of arcane magic in it! They must be driven back, or the violet city will burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.2;Dalaran shall not fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.3;The elves explain to you that the demons have been attracted by the massive use of arcane magic across Dalaran. They suggest limiting the use of magic to remedy this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.3a;Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTRIS.3b;Bah! We can just kill the demons as they appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.3c;Perhaps there's another way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPTIRIS.3;A secret order will be created to deal with the threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restricted_magic;Restricted Magic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETIRIS.4;The Council of Tirisfal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.4;You issue the decree, an extremely secret group of only the best the magi in the Northlands is form. Its duty to combat demonic influence and guide the human realms as needed, always covertly. The first target of the order has already been decided: a dreadlord, Kathra'nathir. His location is yet uknown, but diviners are already hard at work to find him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.4;We must fight the demons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.5;Your agents finally find the dreadlord that is terrorizing Dalaran. Kathra'nathir. This nathrezim reportedly has slaughtered entire armies with his blade, Apocalypse. You and the rest of the Council corner him and start to channel their powers into you, the spearhead. This will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.5a;You will fall, demon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP.5aa;You banish the dreadlord, at a cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP.5ab;You banish the dreadlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP.5ac;The dreadlord overpowers you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.5b;For the Legion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPTIRIS.5b;Turn against your peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.6;Lead by the spearhead, [From.GetBestName], you and your peers corner the foul dreadlord Kathra'nathir and banish him from Azeroth. If he returns, it won't be for a very long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.7;Lead by the spearhead, [From.GetBestName], you and your peers corner the foul dreadlord Kathra'nathir and banish him from Azeroth. If he returns, it won't be for a very long time. Unfortunately, not all survive the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.8;Lead by the spearhead, [From.GetBestName], you and your peers corner the foul dreadlord Kathra'nathir. Unfortunately, it seems you underestimated the demon's power, for he slaughters his way through the assembled magi with claws and magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.9;Betrayal! The spearhead, [From.GetBestName], had been working with the dreadlord all along! As soon as your power was channeled into [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] and the demon started slaughtering the assembled magi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.10;While the Council's current method of fighting demons, having the the Council members empower the current spearhead, work, it has its downsides. The greatest of which is that it requires all of the magi to assemble together and be constantly near the spearhead, leaving them vunlnerable to attacks. A member of the council instead proposes a ritual that would empower a mage into a sort of guardian, who'd then range across the land rooting out demons and cultists, returning after a century of service to pass on the mantle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.10a;It just might work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPTIRIS.10;An apprentice is selected for the role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.10b;No, it'll never work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETIRIS.11;The First Guardian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.11;A new way to fight the corrupting influence of the Legion has been devised. Instead of the risky method of empowering the spearhead on the battlefield itself, a new ritual was devised in order to grant powers, in a long-term fashion, to a promising apprentice selected from the ranks of Dalaran's finest. This Guardian of Tirisfal will range across the world, rooting out corruption and demons wherever they hide. And after a hundred years of service, they will return to the council so that another Guardian may be chosen to replace them. The first of this line has already been selected: Alodi, an orphaned half-elf apprentice who shows great promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.15a;The time has come for Magna [old_guardian.GetFirstName] to pass on the mantle of Guardian of Tirisfal to another. Dutifuly, [old_guardian.GetSheHe] returns [old_guardian.GetHerHis] powers back to the Council, who pass it on to the next Guardian, [guardian.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.15b;With the death of Magna [old_guardian.GetFirstName], [old_guardian.GetFirstName] return to the Council. Another Guardian is then appointed, [guardian.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.15c;The unthinkable has happened! The Guardian, [guardian.GetFirstName], has turned [guardian.GetHerHis] back on the Council, calling you a group of power-mongers and manipulators, and refused to return [guardian.GetHerHis] powers! [guardian.GetSheHe] has stormed off to places unknown, but who knows what [guardian.GetSheHe] might do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.15b;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.15c;If the Guardian won't return by [guardian.GetHerselfHimself], we will make [guardian.GetHerHim] submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPTIRIS.15;Create a new order to hunt down the Guardian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.17;The renegade Guardian, [guardian.GetFirstName], has finally died. With [guardian.GetHerHis] death, the line of the Guardians of Tirisfal has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.17;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.22;The travelling mage [guardian.GetFirstName] has exposed your true alleigance to the rest of the court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTIRIS.22a;You've meddled for the last time, mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP.22;You'll duel this mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.23a;The travelling mage [guardian.GetFirstName] has exposed [From.GetBestName] as a cultist of the [From.Religion.GetName]. Now they prepare to face each other in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.23b;The travelling mage [guardian.GetFirstName] has exposed [From.GetBestName] as a cultist of the [From.Religion.GetName]. [From.GetBestName] beat a hasty retreat, however, and is being pursued by the guards and [guardian.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.25;A strange human mage managed to slip past or overpower all your guards and defences and now stands before you, silently challenging you to combat. You sense great power in [guardian.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTIRIS.32;After overhearing some of the conversations in your court, you become convinced that someone is spreading scandalous rumours in an attempt to slander you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIRIS.33a;Returning to your chambers, you find a letter on your desk, addressed to you. Inside is a demand from this unknown individual that you perform for them, without question a task when asked for in the future. If you refuse, your darkest secrets, actually specified in the letter, will become public knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
