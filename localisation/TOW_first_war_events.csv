EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_1;A New Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_1;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Lion of [k_stormwind.GetName], the valiant [Root.GetTitle]. For eighteen years our kingdom has flourished and prospered.\nSince the war with the Gurubashi trolls, you have come to terms with your responsibility as a [Root.GetTitle] and gained confidence in your actions. The kingdom thrives and your people are as content as they can be.\n\nAlas, the peace of our country is threatened once again. The southern borders speak about a restless shadow lurking in the jungles of Black Morass. Several of our patrols have gone missing and there are reports of mysterious magical activity in the area. [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_1;Summon the Guardian. He will know what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_1;Ask the grand marshal to lead a special scouting party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_1;There is no need to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_2;A Royal Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_2;You have been summoned to the throne room. Your [From.GetQueenKing] looks concerned as [From.GetSheHe] explains you a dire situation [From.GetSheHe] has found [From.GetHerselfHimself] in. A strange magical activity is bound to be found in the jungles of Black Morass. You have the knowledge of this mysterious magical source and you are somehow able to tell, that you have ventured into the southern jungles recently. Yet you have no memory of what you have been up to there or what have you seen.\nYou swear to your friend that you will attend to this matter, but in your head you have to once again ponder about your moodiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_2;I will bring you the answers, dear [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_3;Ominous News;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_3;Guardian [From.GetFirstName] has asked for an immediate audience with you, your grace. [From.GetSheHeCap] storms your throne room in blistering flashes of light, slowly materializing from thin air. [From.GetHerHisCap] reports are not joyous indeed. [From.GeHerHisCap] cloak is rugged and [From.GetHerHis] face grim as [From.GetSheHe] tells you the tale of [From.GetHerHis] latest venture into Black Morass. The shadow indeed fell on the lush jungle to the south. A group of green skinned barbarians are settling down there as you speak. They are war hungry primitives but they hold a great power never seen by even a tired guardian [From.GetHerselfHimself]. What is worse, they have come through a magical portal. [From.GetFirstName] believes, that those barbarians hail from a different world, not like ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_3;Call our banners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;We stand in the brink of war and we will stand together as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_3;Prepare our defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;If the Guardian do not trust these foreigners, nor shall I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_3;We shall contact them and establish peaceful negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;Emissaries will be sent to negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_4;Severed Heads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_4;It appears the green skinned creatures do not embrace diplomacy. Of two diplomats you sent to welcome the strangers into our land, only their heads returned. It is a nasty situation and you understand now, that there will be no deals. Green skinned invaders hunger only for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_4;So it is as I feared after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_5;A Curious Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_5;The orcs as they call themselves have answered to your pleas. They will end all of their hostilities against your nation and they will live peacefully only in the lands Black Morass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_5;It worked. But the conflict may be inevitable nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_6;Relieving News;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_6;Guardian [From.GetFirstName] has come to pay you a visit, my lord. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks tired but [From.GetSheHe] smiles nonetheless. [From.GetFirstName] bows [From.GetHerHis] head and starts to tell you an incredible tale about how [From.GetSheHe] ventured down south to Black Morass as you commanded [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] witnessed what lurks in the jungle. A bunch of primitives from land far away has built some crude dwellings there and now they try to chase away any unwelcome visitors. Their numbers are counting just in few dozens and they are not of a threat to your kingdom. [From.GetFirstName] offers you that [From.GetSheHe] will gladly deal with them by himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_6;They are all yours, my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_6_TOOLTIP;[From.GetFirstName] will handle the case onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_6;We shall double up the patrols, just to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_6_TOOLTIP;Provinces bordering the §Y[e_horde.GetFullName]§! will gain slightly improved defences for 2 years and a regiment of §Y500§!-men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_6;If they mean no other harm to us, then we will leave them alone as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_7;An Expedition South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_7;You have been summoned to the throne room. Your [Liege.GetKingQueen] looks concerned as [Liege.GetSheHe] explains you a dire situation [Liege.GetSheHe] has found [Liege.GetHerselfHimself] in. Your next mission will be perilous indeed. There are reports of patrols gone missing on the southern border with Black Morass. A strange magical activity seems to disrupt any further investigation. Your task is to personally lead a scouting party deep into the jungle. The [Liege.GetKingQueen] believes that only you have the capabilities of finding out, what lurks in the shadows of that unforgiving land.\n\nSummon your best men, sharpen your blade and ready your steed. You ride south before the next daybreak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_7;I will bring the answers or I will die trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_8;Death in Black Morass;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_8;Your scouting party has entered the swamped area early this morning. Humid temperature and poisonous environment has already claimed one of your companions. Timothy was unfortunately left behind to be a sad remainder of what dangerous the nature itself can inflict. But he ought to be just the first out of many.\nWhen those green monstrosities emerged from behind, you had a little means of response. A quick and brutal skirmish lasted just a few moments before your blood has been spilt and your body was struck down by a hammer bigger then yourself. You had mere seconds to reconcile before your mind departed away from this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_8;Someone must warn the [Liege.GetKingQueen]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_9;They Are Too Many;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_9;You lie down completely hidden behind a cover made up of jungle leafs. You do not dare to believe your own eyes upon seeing the great green tide. Your company has just discovered a hidden outpost of those strange new creatures hiding within the thick jungle of Black Morass. Bloody red banners with strange crude black symbol flicker all over the savage camp. Spiked buildings have been erected in place of former jungle overgrowth and the war camp itself is cramped with muscular green foreigners. There could already be many thousands of them. You should return to your [Liege.GetKingQueen] and inform [Liege.GetHerHim] about this threat. If you manage to go out of the swamps unharmed, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_9;Men, be careful now. It is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_10;A Sound Retreat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_10;Verdant wilds of Black Morass claimed their first victim earlier that day when Timothy was engulfed by a huge carnivorous plant. There was no body to bury, no time for solace. The muscular green skinned warriors soon descended upon your company and decimated what has left. They were huge, towering over you and carrying weapons bigger than a grown up man. They spoke no known language and wear primitive hides.\nYou stand a sole survivor of that massacre now and you decide to return home and inform the [Liege.GetKingQueen]. Unfortunately, not many information of value was acclaimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_10;Solace must wait. I have a long way to walk alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_11;A Great Hero Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_11;There is a nervous soldier, a rugged footman, patiently waiting for his time to be summoned before you. His body is shaking as he approaches you and he is afraid to look at you. When you finally persuade him to speak up, he starts talking about absurd events happening down the south. It appears he was a member of the scouting party dispatched and led by [marshal.GetTitledFirstName] [marshal.GetHerselfHimself]. And he claims that he is all that is left of that party. They were ambushed by green skinned creatures of unseen brutality. Beasts double the size of man, their strength unmatched in combat. Even the brave hero of our age, the great [marshal.GetFullName] has fallen under their barbarian sway. They possess a great peril for our nation, sire. How shall we act?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_11;We will avenge our fallen heroes. This is an act of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_11_TOOLTIP;Start a preemptive war with the §Y[e_horde.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_11;Prepare our defences. I fear the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_12;Oncoming Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_12;Your grand marshal storms your chambers without a proper summon. It is early in the morning and [marshal.GetFirstName] looks filthy, rugged and on the brink of collapse. You ease [marshal.GetHerHim] and offer [marshal.GetHerHim] a cup of tea. [marshal.GetSheHeCap] insists to tell you what [marshal.GetSheHe] witnessed and what [marshal.GetSheHe] will not forget for the rest of [marshal.GetHerHis] life. [marshal.GetSheHeCap] personally led a scouting party into the unforgiving jungle. The Black Morass is now swarmed by green skinned creatures of pure brutality. [marshal.GetFirstName] is not able to tell you how many of them are there nor from where they came. But [marshal.GetSheHe] is convinced, that if we do not prepare, [k_stormwind.GetName] will be overwhelmed and eventually will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_12;That is terrible news. We shall stand together and defend our homeland whatever the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_12_TOOLTIP;Provinces bordering the §Y[e_horde.GetFullName]§! will have improved defences for 2 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_12;Rest now, my friend. The situation is less dire then what you think, for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_13;Strange Creatures on the Horizon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_13;Your grand marshal kneels before you and you already fear the worst. [marshal.GetSheHeCap] has it written in [marshal.GetHerHis] face. [marshal.GetFirstName] looks concerned, tired, [marshal.GetHerHis] armour bruised and beaten. You shake your head in disbelief when [marshal.GetSheHe] starts to tell you the tales of what happened to [marshal.GetHerHis] scouting expedition. 
They were ambushed not far into the jungle. They had no time to find anything of value. The rest is a short story filled with green monsters twice the size of a grown up man. It is the story of rage and destruction. [marshal.GetFirstName] is the only [marshal.GetManWoman] remaining of [marshal.GetHerHis] company. All others have been violently murdered by uncanny green brutes hiding in Black Morass. How shall we respond, sire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_13;We need to know more. Send another expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_13;Rest now, my friend. The situation is less dire then what you think, for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_14;Another Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_14;Your [Liege.GetQueenKing] asks of you that another expedition must be accomplished, as [Liege.GetSheHe] is not entirely sure as to what measures to take for the situation in the Black Morass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_14;I will bring definitive answers this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_15;Another Lost Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_15;When you meet with your grand marshal to discuss the latest news on the southern border, [marshal.GetSheHe] greets you with a grim face. Another expedition was lost in the jungle, never to be seen again. You understand now, that your kingdom faces a greater threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_15;We must be ready, when the storm descends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_16;A Dangerous Flight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_16;Wind guides you as you fly on your gryphon. A venture into Black Morass was a swift one, although really concerning one. From the back of your steady gryphon you have seen part of the overgrowth stumped by green skinned barbarians, ones of intimidating physique. Somehow you possess some valuable information on them already, as it slowly resurfaces back into your mind. They are called orcs and they hail from a dying world by the name of Draenor somewhere in the stars.\nYou know one more thing. Orcs of Draenor travelled into black jungle through magical means. They have used a demonic magic known to you simply as fel to open a path in shape of a small portal situated in desolate place. A nefarious magic the fel is.\nWhen you bury yourself into your mind, one realisation is clear more and more. They have been told about your world of Azeroth. Somebody invited them on purpose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_16;Why is my mind suddenly so clouded?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_16;I shall inform [FromFrom.GetFirstName] immediately about my findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_17;A Lion at War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_17;My [Root.GetQueenKing], those vile beasts are on the move at last. The orcs of the Horde have finally taken arms and now they march for a merciless war against us. There is no turning back. We stand at a great crossroad that shall shape our future for ever. These green skinned barbarians lust only for blood and nothing can quench their thirst for it. A potent magical source described as demonic fel empowers these creatures, so they possess intimidating inhuman strength and their warlocks are capable of casting meteorites onto the battlefield.\nOur courage and valour will be our best companions in these troubling times. Stout forts will serve as bastions of hope protecting our nation and your crown. Ready your man, sire. There is no time to hesitate.\nFor from this day, we are at war with the Horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_17;For [k_stormwind.GetName]! I will not fail my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_18;A Lion at War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_19;A New Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_19;Loneliness is consuming you once more, master. Many years have passed since the last banquet of Karazhan was held within these halls. Those joyous times are long gone. By now your only companions left are Moroes, your faithful servant, and the last remnants of your sanity. A strange moodiness clouds your judgement and rules over your common sense. You are the knowledgeable guardian, yet any knowledge required to cure you is alluding you still.\nMaster, those foolish amateurs from [k_dalaran.GetName], the so called archmages would like to know the secrets of your mysterious tower. They have tried in the past to retrieve those mysteries from your vault into their power hungry possession and they will try again in the future for sure. A young apprentice named [khadgar.GetFirstName] now stands before you. Sent by mages of Kirin Tor [khadgar.GetSheHe] is nervously lowering [khadgar.GetHerHis] head in fear and respect. [khadgar.GetHerHisCap] eyes shine in wonder though and you see a great potential in this young one. Could [khadgar.GetSheHe] be the one to provide you a much needed company in this tower of dread?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_19;Come forward, [khadgar.GetFirstName]. I have a task for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_19;I need no company. Be gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_20;A Lion under Siege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_20;Master, your mind has been clouded for several days still. Well-known powers are consuming your spirit and they do not plan to stop there. You have been inflicted with vicious fel magic. That green curse fills your body with giddiness. Or is the curse how you want to call it?\nShall not you consider it a gift? Your magical prowess grew stronger ever since the orcs came onto this world. You feel as you could level the mountains, relocating the oceans far... The power is intoxicating and seductive. Is it supposed to be? Shall you become the avatar of change?\nWhich side are you on, master?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_20;I shall bring ruin! Sargeras calls me hence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_20;No, I will not give in... Not yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_21;A New World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_21;Akamagosh, great warchief, almighty [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick], warlord of the [Root.GetLastWordInDynastyName] clan. Welcome to the new world. It is lush and full of ripe fruits to feed our hungry. A wild prey is plentiful and local civilization is weak. You have listened to Guldan, you have guided your people through the Dark Portal and here you stand. Finally in all its glory, you see another world ready to be conquered. In a short moment, your home world of Draenor just became only a distant memory in the stars beyond. In order to take these lands for the Horde, you have to deal with the locals first. Scouts have noticed at least two other races inhabiting this jungle region and its surroundings. Pink skinned humans with massive stone fortresses and plate armour are the first. Blue skinned trolls, lanky creatures living in many temple ruins dotting the overgrowth nearby, are the second. This is perfect opportunity to wipe them clear and sooth your lust for blood. The humans particularly seem to be much more of the fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_21;This land belongs to the Horde now! Lok-Tar Ogar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_22;Decorated Warrior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_22;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], one of your brave warriors have come to your tent with an interesting report. They have ambushed a human scouting party far north. Those weaklings didnt stand a chance, but one of them was particularly strange. Your warriors have dragged his body to your main base, so you could see him with your own eyes.\nA balding man with decorated armour lies by your feet, his body now completely lifeless. Golden ornaments were not able to protect his life. In the end, all humans will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_22;On the stake with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_23;Retaliation Strike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_24;Retaliation Strike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_24;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], the time has come. We will no longer hide behind the trees. Now we will hunt all those puny humans and we will feast on their blood. The Horde marches for war!\nYou have called all your warlords present on this world. It is an army to behold. Each of your warriors has been empowered by a godly gift. Blood of Mannaroth has made them unstoppable; fel magic has granted your warlocks power unimaginable. And there is also this ever urging lust for blood, for violence, for war. With such determination, you will conquer this world within months.\nNothing more but a victory awaits you, as your banners fly high and your grunts march for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_24;Lok-tar Ogar! For the Horde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_24;No, we are not prepared yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_24_TOOLTIP;You gain an §YInvasion§! casus belli against the §Y[k_stormwind.GetFullName]§! for 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_27;A New Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_27;Greetings, lord [Root.GetDynName]. For the years past you have served the [k_stormwind.GetName] crown with pride and valour. The lands bestowed upon you have flourished never more. Last eighteen years were truly bountiful and fertile. Your subjects do not hunger, your burghers do not grumble. The stock is fed and the fields are golden with ripe grain every year.\nYet this prosperity is not to last forever. Dark clouds grasp the horizon in the south where the perilous jungle of Black Morass wakes from its dormant state. There is a threat on the move. Monstrous green skinned warriors now roam the jungle uncontested. We do not know, when or where will they strike out but we shall stand prepared. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_27;For [k_stormwind.GetName]! For the [Liege.GetQueenKing]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_28;A New Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_28;Greetings, lord [Root.GetDynName], a great hero of [k_stormwind.GetName]. Your renown precedes you. The tales of your deeds and bravery are sung and celebrated across the realms of men. Your bloodline stretches far into the past, to glorious days of Arathor. As the last descendant of Thoradin you feel as a great responsibility is resting on your shoulders uneasily. Your legendary ancestor once unified all of human tribes to preserve your race and your culture. Together with high elves, he fended off a threat of mighty troll invasion. Now it is up to you to be a hero, that mankind needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOW_FW_41;Time is money, my Trade prince. We have seen profitable years and there are more to come. We have prospered from naval commerce and we have built machinery unrivalled.\nEast of Booty Bay lies future beneficial investment, my prince. Rumours about green skinned invaders have leaked. If they are to invade [k_stormwind.GetName] humans, they will need to arm themselves with some goblin engineering. Make sure, you offer them the best deals anywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_41;Lets make a bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
