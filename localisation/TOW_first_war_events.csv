EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_1;A New Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_1;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Lion of [k_stormwind.GetName], the valiant [Root.GetTitle]. For eighteen years our kingdom has flourished and prospered.\nSince the war with the Gurubashi trolls, you have come to terms with your responsibility as a [Root.GetTitle] and gained confidence in your actions. The kingdom thrives and your people are as content as they can be.\n\nAlas, the peace of our country is threatened once again. The southern borders speak about a restless shadow lurking in the jungles of Black Morass. Several of our patrols have gone missing and there are reports of mysterious magical activity in the area. [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_1;Summon the Guardian. He will know what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_1;Ask the grand marshal to lead a special scouting party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_1;There is no need to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_3;Ominous News;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_3;Guardian [From.GetFirstName] has asked for an immediate audience with you, your grace. [From.GetSheHeCap] storms your throne room in blistering flashes of light, slowly materializing from thin air. [From.GetHerHisCap] reports are not joyous indeed. [From.GeHerHisCap] cloak is rugged and [From.GetHerHis] face grim as [From.GetSheHe] tells you the tale of [From.GetHerHis] latest venture into Black Morass. The shadow indeed fell on the lush jungle to the south. A group of green skinned barbarians are settling down there as you speak. They are war hungry primitives but they hold a great power never seen by even a tired guardian [From.GetHerHim]self. What is worse, they have come through a magical portal. [From.GetFirstName] believes, that those barbarians hail from a different world, not like ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_3;Call our banners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;We stand in the brink of war and we will stand together as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_3;Prepare our defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;If the Guardian do not trust these foreigners, nor shall I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_3;We shall contact them and establish peaceful negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_3_TOOLTIP;Emissaries will be sent to negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_4;Severed Heads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_4;It appears the green skinned creatures do not embrace diplomacy. Of two diplomats you sent to welcome the strangers into our land, only their heads returned. It is a nasty situation and you understand now, that there will be no deals. Green skinned invaders hunger only for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_4;So it is as I feared after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_5;A Curious Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_5;The orcs as they call themselves have answered to your pleas. They will end all of their hostilities against your nation and they will live peacefully only in the lands Black Morass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_5;It worked. But the conflict may be inevitable nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TOW_FW_6;Relieving News;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_FW_6;Guardian [From.GetFirstName] has come to pay you a visit, my lord. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks tired but [From.GetSheHe] smiles nonetheless. [From.GetFirstName] bows [From.GetHerHis] head and starts to tell you an incredible tale about how [From.GetSheHe] ventured down south to Black Morass as you commanded [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] witnessed what lurks in the jungle. A bunch of primitives from land far away has built some crude dwellings there and now they try to chase away any unwelcome visitors. Their numbers are counting just in few dozens and they are not of a threat to your kingdom. [From.GetFirstName] offers you that [From.GetSheHe] will gladly deal with them by himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_6;They are all yours, my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_FW_6_TOOLTIP;[From.GetFirstName] will handle the case onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_FW_6;We shall double up the patrols, just to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_FW_6;If they mean no other harm to us, then we will leave them alone as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
