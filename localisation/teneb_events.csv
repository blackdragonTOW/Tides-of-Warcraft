It seems that [From.GetTitledName] agrees with this, and is working on transitioning the government of the gnomes to its newest form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEDWRF.21;The Technocrats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDWRF.21;As of late, a new ideology has arisen in the gnomish realm of Gnomeregan: the idea that a ruler should be not some noble who inherited their title, but a scholar or technician elected by their peers. The gnomish monarch, however, is less than pleased and denounced such ideas. Frustrated, the technocrats of Gnomeregan have taken up arms and seek to depoise their [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDWRF.23;[From.GetTitledName], last [From.GetTitle] of Gnomeregan has been defeated by the technocratic rebellion, and a new form of government is now used by the gnomes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEDWRF.25;Enlightened Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDWRF.25;The technocratic rebellion that rose up against [From.GetTitledName] in Gnomeregan has been put down. As the last pockets of resistance are rooted out, it appears that is the monarchy that is truly enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
