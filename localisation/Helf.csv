EVTDESCSUNWELL.23;Lately the cravings have been getting worse. The need to consume mana, regardless of the source, is overwhelming. What harm a little mana could do, after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.23a;Yes, a little won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.23b;No, I must stay strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSUNWELL.28;Pain wracks both your body and mind. Your mana addiction is no longer a craving, but an overriding urge. You can feel it changing you. You start stooping over. Growths along your back. A hollowness inside. And the hunger. Oh, the hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.28;Where is the mana?! Give it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.29;[From.GetBestName] has failed to control [From.GetHerHis] urges and overindulged, becoming wretched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTSUNWELL.37a;I will find a way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.37b;We will just need to learn to cope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.39;One of the many groups of Silvermoon's finest you have sent out to find a solution to the plight of your people report that they have found something... strange. You personally venture out, through a portal conjured by a magister, to its location and you see what they meant by strange. What looks like a conglomerate of geometric shards floats in the air awash in light... and in magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.39a;Approach it, ask for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.39b;Capture it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.40;You approach the being and plead your case. You explain how the Sunwell, that fed and sustained your people, is now gone. It merely floats there passively while you explain. Once you are done, a moment of silent falls and as you are about to leave, it speaks into your mind, with a voice not unlike chimes. It will try to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.40;You depart back to the Sunwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDECSUNWELL.41;Arriving at the Sunwell, the beign, that identifies itself as a 'Naaru', proclaims, after a brief inspection, that it can indeed restore it. It warns however, that it may go 'dark' as a result. It tells you to ready yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.41;Let's do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.42;The Naaru starts glowing brighter and brighter until you are forced to close your eyes lest you go blind. When you open your eyes the Sunwell is alight again! There seems to be some changes within it, however. The Naaru, shining a little less than before, explains that this new Sunwell burns not only with arcane magic, but with the power of the Light as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.42;A glorious day for Quel'Thalas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.43;The Sunwell, Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.43;Through the valiant efforts of [From.GetTitledName], the Sunwell, heart of Quel'Thalas and source of sustenance for its people, has been restored! May its glory shine forever more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.44;The Naaru starts glowing brighter and brighter until you are forced to close your eyes lest you go blind. When you open your eyes the Sunwell is alight again! Yet the Naaru who has aided you seems... wrong. It is dark and no longer shining with light. More worryingly, shadowy beings are starting to manifest all around it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.44;To arms! Defend the Sunwell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDECSUNWELL.45;Arriving at the Sunwell, the beign, that identifies itself as a 'Naaru', proclaims, after a brief inspection, that it cannot restore the Sunwell. It apologizes and offers to at least teach those who are interested to call upon the light to aid them as you continue to search for a solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.45;Oh well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.46;The creature tries to resist, but your forces eventually manage to subdue it and transport it back to Quel'Thalas. Your magisters quickly set out to examining it. This will take some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.47;After their examination, the magisters say that this creature can indeed restore the Sunwell. As its energy is drained is starts to become darker, and dark beings start to appear around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDECSUNWELL.48;After thorough and exhaustive examination, the magisters determine that this creature cannot be used to restore the sunwell. However, it can be used as a living battery from which some of your people could draw power from. Particularly, light-based magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.49;Your attempts are capturing the creature fail and it escapes. It seems you'll need to find another way to do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.50;Disaster! It seems that the strain caused by draining the captive crystalline creature, the so-called Naaru, has caused it to transform into some unspeakable horror. It and the monsters it has spawned now rampage across Silvermoon itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.50;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VOID_BEINGS;Void Creatures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.52;[From.GetFullName] approaches you with an interesting offer. Given that your people now have access to the powers of the Light, [From.GetSheHe] proposes the creation of an order of light-wielding warrior, paladins if you will, to aid in the defense of Quel'Thalas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.53;The Blood Knights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSUNWELL.52;The Blood Knights are formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.53;"By royal decree, an order of light-wielding warriors has been formed for the protection of the realm. They have been named ""Blood Knights"" and are being to be led by [FromFrom.GetTitledName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWLL.54;Scouts report that they have found a group of extremly old ruins, predating even the War of the Ancients. Perhaps within it lies a solution for your people's plight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.54a;I shall go there personally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.54b;Send an expedition at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.55;You arrive at the ruins. They truly are old, and seem like they were old even during the reign of Queen Azshara. Still you brace yourself and head inside. You and your party make your way through dust-covered corridors and deactivated constructs until you finally reach a gilded door, sealed shut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.55;This won't stop us. Open the door!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.56;It takes some time, but your party manages to force the door open. On the other side you see many screens of pure light displaying... information? Taking a closer look you see reports on something called the 'Curse of Flesh', the development of trolls and... could it be? A detailed report on the Well of Eternity! With this information, it should be possible to restore the Sunwell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.57;It takes some time, but your party manages to force the door open. On the other side you see many screens of pure light displaying... information? Taking a closer look you see reports on something called the 'Curse of Flesh', the development of trolls, weather patterns across the world. Nothing, however, that will help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.57;At least we can use some of this information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.58;The group you sent to investigate the ancient ruins finally returns, triumphant. They report that in that location they saw many strange and wondrous things, but the real prize was a detailed report on the Well of Eternity! With this, the magisters can surely restore the Sunwell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.59;The group you sent to investigate the ancient ruins finally returns. They report that in that location they saw many strange and wondrous things, including a lot of diverse information. Sadly, none of that includes a solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.60;The search of a way to restore the Sunwell continues to bear no results. Could it be futile? Could there be no solution? And if so, are there any alternatives?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.60a;I cannot give in to despair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.60b;There must be another way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.61;Tentacles writhing in darkness. Stone turning to flesh. Whispers. An empire, black and ominous, of tendrils and chitin, laboring under a mountain of flesh, eyes, mouths. Unfathomable. Unknowable. And yet, nostalgic. You wake up from the strange dream, shaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.61;Could that have been real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.62;The whispers follow you even while you're awake now. They tell you things. About those around you. About the world. About how your people need not suffer under their need for the Arcane. Flesh is a gift from the true gods of this world, the whispers say. Those gods can deliver you from your plight. Serve them in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.62a;I will do anything to save my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.62b;N-never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.63;The Call of the Void;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.63;[From.GetTitleName] is proposing a radical, perhaps outrageous, solution to the maddical addiction of your people. There are powers in this world, [From.GetSheHe] claims, that can sustain you, empower you. All they demand is that you join them. Old Gods, [From.GetSheHe] calls them. The true gods of this world. Their Black Empire toppled eons ago by the Titans. They can save you, or so [From.GetTitledName] says. [From.GetSheHe] seems to believe so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.63a;Whatever gets me rid of the thirst for magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.63b;[From.GetSheHe]'s gone mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.64;It occurs to you: the Sunwell was fountain of magical power. Perhaps it can be ignited once more by pouring great quantities of magic into it? Some of the magisters you ask dismiss the idea, but others suggest it might work. Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.64a;Let's give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.64b;It may require some resources. They'll have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.64c;Spare no expense in getting the best for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.65;It worked! The assembled magisters performed a ritual that injected truly titanic quanities of arcane forces into the Sunwell. And to think the solution was within your grasp all this time! Elven ingenuity is proved once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.66;Despite the titanic quantity of arcane energy spent in this endeavour, the magisters failed to restore the Sunwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.67;The search of a way to restore the Sunwell continues to bear no results. In desperation, you've taken through pouring through the ancient records of the founding of the kingdom. Though you were the same people once, the kaldorei never suffered from the thirst magic thanks to their drudic connection to nature. Maybe there's something to that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.67a;I need to look into this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.67b;Bah! The ways of peasants don't interest me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.68;It takes a lot of research through all of the realm's archives, and you even had rangers 'persuade' troll druids to part with their knowledge. But you think you have it. If revived, drudism could be the way for your people to adapt to this new reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.68;It is the only way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.69;Drudism Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.69;[From.GetTitleName] seems to have found a solution to the crisis griping the realm: the revival of the druidic traditions followed by your long-distant kaldorei kin. It is unusual to be sure, but [From.GetSheHe] no longer seems to thirst for magic like you do. Perhaps there is something to it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.69a;If it works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.69b;What is this nonsense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.70;Despite your efforts, it seems that your idea will bear no fruit. Druidism is not the future of Quel'Thalas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.71;The search of a way to restore the Sunwell continues to bear no results. But there could be alternatives. Fel magic is potent and readily available. And the price is so small...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.71a;I am not so desperate as to try this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.71b;I must see if it works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.72;It works! It works! Sure, there are some side effects, but they are truly minor if compared to what your people are currently going through. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.62a;They need to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.72b;The Legion offers further power still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.73;The Fel Solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.73;[From.GetTitleName] claims to have found a solution to the undending thirst for magic that plagues the people of Quel'Thalas: to feed of Fel magic instead. It is, [From.GetSheHe] claims, readily available, unlike arcane magic, and offers great opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.74;[From.GetTitleName] claims to have found a solution to the undending thirst for magic that plagues the people of Quel'Thalas: to feed of Fel magic instead. It is, [From.GetSheHe] claims, readily available, unlike arcane magic, and offers great opportunity. And if you were to submit to the Burning Legion, they'd surely reward Quel'Thalas and its people with infinite power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.75;In search for a way to restore the Sunwell, you decide to look to other races as for how they get their magic. Humans have nothing of interest to you, but the troll seem to get a lot of magic from their 'gods', the Loa. Maybe you should send some rangers to... acquire one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.75a;Send the rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.75b;As if the trolls had anything we could ever want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.76;After a long while, the rangers finally return with the captured Loa in a magical cage. The troll 'god' constantly tests the cage, trying to break free. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.76;Take it to the Sunwell before it manages to get loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.77;As if sensing what is about the happen, the Loa tries harder to break free. Unfortunately for it, it fails in this endeavour. Your magisters, however, achieve a great success in binding the Loa's energies to the Sunwell, sacrificing the beign in the process. The Sunwell is, once more, whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.78;As if sensing what is about the happen, the Loa tries harder to break free. It eventually manages to overpower the cage and has to be put down before it can cause too much damage. Another solution will be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.79;After a long while without contact, some of the rangers you sent out return, battered and bloody. The Loa and its troll servants overpowered the rangers, killing many of their number and sending the rest into a rout. The few survivors were hunted almost all the way back to the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.80;A daring solution to restoring the Sunwell occurs to you: Blue Dragons are not only inherently magical creatures, like other dragons, but are particularly attuned to arcane magic. If you were to capture and 'persuade' one of them, you could restore the Sunwell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.80a;It just might work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSUNWELL.80;Rangers are sent out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.80b;No, this is a stupid idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.81;The rangers of Quel'Thalas have surely surpassed themselves on this day. They have captured a living adult dragon of the Blue Dragonflight! The dragon constantly spouts threats of retribution if it is not released, but the rangers assure you there is no risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.81;To work, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.82;The process is complete, and the Sunwell restored! Clearly this was the correct course of action. May Quel'Thalas prosper once more! The dragon has, of course, expired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.83;It seems your guess was wrong and the procedure failed. The Sunwell continues extinct and the dragon has expired, preventing another attempt at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.84;It seems the captive dragon's threats were very much real. A force of blue dragons and their dragonspawn servitors has landed in the northwestern coast of Quel'Thalas and marches on the kingdom, bent on vengeance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
AZURE_HOST;Azure Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.85;After a long while without contact, some of the rangers you sent out return, battered and bloody. The dragon proved to much for them and slaughtered most of the force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.86;The problem of restoring the Sunwell defies resolution. New ideas are proposed and readily discarded as impractical or outlandish. Sometimes, you wish you could just go back in time and prevent this disaster from happening in the first place. Alas, that is the domain of the Bronze Dragonflight alone, and they aren't keen on altering past events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.86;There must be a way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.87;While resting in your quarters, you are suprised by a light, possibly intentional, cough. You turn to find a hooded figure, dressed in grey, standing not far from you. How they evaded you guards is unknown, but before you can sound the alarm, the figure asks that you listen to what they has to say. A way to make things just like they were, they say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.87a;Guards! Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.87b;I'm listening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.88;Whomever it may be, whatever they can do, you are not interested. You yell for your guards, who rush in, weapons drawn. The figure batters them aside with magic and dashes out of the room. No one sees it leaving the building, just like none have seen it come in. Strange indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.89;The intruder explains that they represent a group who is more than capable of correcting the past, righting wrongs like the destruction of the Sunwell. Of course, which such a service comes a price. This one, they assure you, is quite simple. You have to swear yourself to their cause. A trifling thing, really, and none need know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.89a;Whatever saves my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.89b;No. Find some other pawn for your schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.90;The Sunwell, Restored?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.90;You are... quite confused. You remember the Sunwell being corrupted, and later destroyed. You remember the grip of the addiction for magic, turning your people into ravenous monsters. The desperate search for a solution. And yet... you don't? It's almost as if it never happened at all. An exceptionally strange affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.90;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.91;A very strange envoy arrives at your court. Naga. The emissary explains that they were highborne much like your people were. Unlike your people, they did not escape the Sundering, being changed by the event into what you see now. Queen Azshara, the envoy explains, would be more than willing to help your people if you were to swear fealty to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.91a;Azshara tried to sell this world to the Legion. No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.91b;... very well, I shall bend the knee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.92;The emissary takes your without betraying any emotion, though her guards certainly seem to take offense. Still, she comments on how that is a pity and wishes you good luck in your efforts before taking her leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.92;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.93;For Nazjatar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.93;[From.GetTitleName], perhaps driven by desperation, had sworn fealty to Queen Azshara, who many though dead, and her naga empire of Nazjatar. In return, the naga promised to help restore the Sunwell. In fact, it does seem like they stayed true to their word, for within days elven magisters assisted by naga sea witches have managed to rekindle the Sunwell thanks to ancient knowledge the naga hold. Still, it is a troubling endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.94;The thought suddenly occurs to you that the undead surely have no problem being addicted to magic. Of course, other won't understand. Not right away at any rate. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.94a;I need to figure out a way first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.94b;No, that's a silly idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.95;The hour of your ascension is at hand! Soon, you will be free from this mortal coil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.95;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLESUNWELL.96;Madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.96;[From.GetTitleName], perhaps driven by mad by [From.GetHerHis] addiction, has turned [From.GetHerselfHimself] into an undead monstrosity, and now seeks to do the same for everyone else as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.97;While wandering the grounds you come across a peculiar sight. A portal framed by three swirling semicircles.  It's almost as if it is... calling you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.97a;Go in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.97b;That seems like a bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.98;You step through the swirling vortex and arrive on... an idyllic farmland? A man with a strange, bulky armour and a blocky gun watches you from a small distance. He steps up and greets you 'Hey there pal, name's Raynor. Welcome to the Nexus. I'm sure you got a lot of questions, but there ain't no time for that. Battle's about to start.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.98;Battle? Nexus? What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.99;No time' he says, and he's off. You follow him. In the next short while you fight against generic soldiers, familiar foes, and some truly outlandish ones. Still, you triumph in the end and destroy the big self-defending structure at the enemy base, the 'Core'. Amongst the loot is a very interesting object.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.99;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.101;You make your way out of the Nexus and you're right back where you were. And the prize you got was just what was needed to restore the Sunwell! You truly are a Hero of the Storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nick_the_hero_of_the_storm;the Hero of the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.102;"No time he says, and he's off. You follow him. In the next short while you fight against generic soldiers, familiar foes, and some truly outlandish ones. Still, you triumph in the end and destroy the big self-defending structure at the enemy base, the ""Core"". While this was a fun romp, you find nothing that could help you before you leave.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.102;I should do this again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUNWELL.103;"No time he says, and he's off. You follow him. In the next short while you fight against generic soldiers, familiar foes, and some truly outlandish ones. Still, you triumph in the end and destroy the big self-defending structure at the enemy base, the ""Core"". But... how do you leave this place?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTSUNWELL.103;This is awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.3;The mind control spell on [From.GetBestName] has worked and [From.GetSheHe] is now loyal to [From.GetHerHis] liege, as it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.5;The mind control spell on [From.GetBestName] has failed and [From.GetSheHe] is now more than a bit angry towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHELFSOC.7;[From.GetBestName] has failed to come up with anything useful as part of the research you ordered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHELFSOC.10a;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.10b;Not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.11;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI agree to your terms. The compensation you demand is included in this message.\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.12;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI shall not let you turn my generous offer into an opportunity for extortion.\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHELFSOC.14;Hearing of a promising archeological site, you quickly pack your tools and hire the necessary help before setting off. After some days of travel you finally arrive at the digsite. What wonders will you find here, you wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.14a;Let's find out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPHELFSOC.14a;This will take some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.14b;I think I made a mistake coming here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHELFSOC.16c;In another area of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.16d;I'll choose later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.24;My liege,\n\nIt is imperative that we reclaim [event_target:reclaim_loc.GetName], as it is an area of vital interest to the kingdom. As such, I am giving you my full support for this action.\n\nSigned, [bk_leader.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.25;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nIt has come to my attention that you have no stance at all in the realm's politics! As such, I find myself compelled to help you understand your patriotic duty. Would you join my political faction so we may strive together for a better Quel'Thalas?\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.25a;You make a good point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHELFSOC.28;[From.GetTitledName] has sent a diplomatic envoy to your court in order to convince you of the benevolence and wise leadership of [qt_king.GetTitledName], your mutual liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.29;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nIt has come to my attention that you seem to believe that Quel'Thalas must isolate itself from the world.

EVTDESCHELFSOC.36;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName]\nI write you on behalf of my gracious liege [qt_king.GetTitledName]. I have been authorized to extend to you a proposal for a non-aggression pact on [qt_king.GetHerHis] behalf.\n\nSigned, [sr_leader.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.36a;Interesting. I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHELFSOC.36b;Interesting, but no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHELFSOC.37;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYou make for a convincing case. I accept your proposal for a non-aggression pact.\n\nSigned, [qt_king.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
