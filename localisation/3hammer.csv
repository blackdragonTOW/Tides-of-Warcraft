EVTTITLE3HAMMER.3;Death of a [From.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.3;The late [From.GetTitledName] was not a particularly notable monarch, having done little in service of Khaz Modan. Perhaps it is time for a stronger ruler to step up and sieze the throne, to best steer the fate of the dwarves towards glory. Someone like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.3a;Yes, it must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.3b;No, that is not the right way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.5a;The late [From.GetTitledName] was not a particularly notable monarch, having done little in service of Khaz Modan. What is worrying, however, is that [event_target:3h_bronzebeard.GetFullName] has risen up to take the throne for [event_target:3h_bronzebeard.GetHerselfHimself]. Will your defend you claim, or accept the fall of your clan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.5b;The late [From.GetTitledName] was not a particularly notable monarch, having done little in service of Khaz Modan. What is worrying, however, is that [event_target:3h_wildhammer.GetFullName] has risen up to take the throne for [event_target:3h_wildhammer.GetHerselfHimself]. Will you defend your claim, or accept the fall of your clan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

What is worrying, however, is that [event_target:3h_darkiron.GetFullName] has risen up to take the throne for [event_target:3h_darkiron.GetHerselfHimself]. Will you defend your claim, or accept the fall of your clan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.5d;The late [From.GetTitledName] was not a particularly notable monarch, having done little in service of Khaz Modan. What is worrying, however, is that [event_target:3h_bronzebeard.GetFullName] and [event_target:3h_wildhammer.GetFullName] have risen up and now fight for the throne. Will you defend your claim, or accept the fall of your clan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.5e;The late [From.GetTitledName] was not a particularly notable monarch, having done little in service of Khaz Modan. What is worrying, however, is that [event_target:3h_bronzebeard.GetFullName] and [event_target:3h_darkiron.GetFullName] have risen up and now fight for the throne.

EVTOPT3HAMMER.5a;No, our time has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.5b;This is MY realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.7;The War of the Three Hammers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.7;A great civil war has engulfed the dwarven realm of Khaz Modan. The clans have risen against their king and now fight for dominance of their mountainous homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.9;The civil war consuming Khaz Modan has ground down to a halt as sides are forced into an uneasy truce. Tensions are sure to rise again though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.10;Revenge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.10;The hostilities may have died down, but you still hold on to fact that you couldn't claim Khaz Modan. Perhaps the time has come to finally claim Ironforge for yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.10a;The time has come! We march on Ironforge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.10b;No, let old hatreds die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.11;[From.GetTitledName] is still holding a grudge over [From.GetHerHis] failure to claim Ironforge during the civil war. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] is currently assembling the forces of [From.GetHerHis] clan to assault you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.12;[From.GetTitledName] is still holding a grudge over [From.GetHerHis] failure to claim Ironforge during the civil war. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] is currently assembling the forces of [From.GetHerHis] clan to assault it! You are in an unique position, however, to restore relations with Ironforge by lending them your aid... or to press your own claim on the ancient fortress-city once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.12a;We shall come to their aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.12b;Ironforge is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.12c;Let them fight their war. I no longer care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.13;The dwarven civil war over Khaz Modan has started once more. The great clans ready their forces and prepare to march against each other in their bid for total supremacy over the moutainous region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.14;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName]/n/nThough we previously fought in the first part of this terrible civil war, I no longer care for claiming the mountain halls you hold. As a gesture of reconciliation, I shall join you in defending against the enemy./n/nSigned,/n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.15;[From.GetTitledName] is still holding a grudge over [From.GetHerHis] failure to claim Ironforge during the civil war. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] is currently assembling the forces of [From.GetHerHis] clan to rejoin this civil war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.17;Grim Batol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.17;The fortress-city of Grim Batol is a formidable foritication and will take a long time to siege. However, Xal'alath tells you of another way. It is willing to help you cast a terrible curse that will surely break the defenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.17a;Yes! Let us turn their fortress into a nightmare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.17b;No, and stop whispering to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.18;The dwarven fortress-city of Grim Batol has been the victim of a terrible curse cast by [From.GetBestName]. Within Grim Batol shadows came to life to slaughter their owners and nightmares became real. Its once proud halls are now a place of terror and madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.19;Though the war is over, Grim Batol continues to be a cursed place of nightmares. Perhaps it would be best if your people were to abandon it and seek a new home elsewhere?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.19a;There is nothing left for us here. Let's seek another home to the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.19b;This is our home, and we are not abandoning it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.20;The war has not been going well for you. The rival clans even now make way into the heartlands of the Dark Irons. All seems lost, but perhaps there is a way. You know of a powerful, secret, ritual. One that could call up elemental legions and bind them to your will. But it will be risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.20a;Begin the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.20b;We win this with dwarven strength or not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.21;Ragnaros!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.21;You commence the ritual. You call upon the power of the fire, deep below the earth. But, through the ritual your thoughts turn to the bitter defeats you have suffered, to the rage you felt as you were thwarted time and again. The rage feeds into the ritual and now it is beyond your control. It reaches deeper, farther. Into the Firelands. Blackrock Mountain explodes, and fire engulfs you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT3HAMMER.21;Tremble, insects!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE3HAMMER.22;Warriors of the Firelands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.22;You commence the ritual. You call upon the power of the fire, deep below the earth. You call forth an army of molten warriors to do your bidding and turn the tide of this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.23;In [From.GetHerHis] attempt at conducting a ritual that would turn the tide of the war [From.GetSheHe] was in, [From.GetTitledName] accidentally summoned the Elemental Lord of Fire, Ragnaros, and died in the prcoess. The northern regions of the Redridge Mountains exploded with his fiery entry into the world, and Ragnaros has subjugated the Dark Iron dwarf clan and now rules from the depths of the now-volcanic Blackrock Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.24;Strange grey dragons have started appearing out of nowhere and have joined your forces in battle. Though you don't know why they do this, this is clearly in your benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3HAMMER.25;A strange new development has arisen in this war. Mysterious grey dragons, unlike any ever seen, appear to have allied themselves with the Dark Iron and could turn the war in their favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
