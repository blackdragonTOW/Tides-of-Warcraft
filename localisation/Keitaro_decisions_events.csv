EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_1;Honoured [From.GetTitledName], I dislike having to request this from you, but your favor to me shall be payed back graciously by a generous donation for our realm.\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOW_Decisions_1;Here is the requested amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOW_Decisions_1;I don't think I want to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TOW_Decisions_1_OPTB;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will not appreciate your refusal.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOW_Decisions_1;I will be pleased to offer you more !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TOW_Decisions_1;This is too much money ! Fewer coins are enough !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_TOW_Decisions_1;Sorry, but you would understand that, at this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_2;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName], here are the [From.TOW_money_count_spent.GetValue]¤ that you have asked, I hope this settles everything.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_TOW_Decisions_2;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_3;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I am afraid I have to decline your offer, my money is too important for that.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_TOW_Decisions_3;How dare you !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_4;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I felt obliged to give you more than what you have asked for, I am convinced that you will use this donation with good intentions. Here are [From.TOW_money_count_spent.GetValue]¤.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_TOW_Decisions_4;Perfect !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_5;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I'm sure the amount of [From.TOW_money_count_spent.GetValue]¤ I sent you is enough, It wouldn't feel right to dispossess the wealth of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_TOW_Decisions_5;What ?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOW_Decisions_6;To the dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], as much as I would like to comply with your request, I am afraid that this could compromise the well-being of the good people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I'm sure we can find a better arrangement for the favor I owe you.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_TOW_Decisions_6;I'm convinced by this argument, that wasn't right of me to request this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
