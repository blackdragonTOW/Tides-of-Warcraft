EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.30a;Let's get to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.30b;Actually, I changed my mind. I'd rather not do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.31;Your studies are over... at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.31b;I should keep this to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.32;You have hit a snag in your studies. Namely, you are out of reading material, and it will be hard to proceed without buying more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.32a;I have no choice, I must buy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP.32;You may be discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.32b;I'll have to do without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.34;You've been having trouble with your studies lately. Perhaps you should get someone to help you? [class_gethelp.GetBestName] could teach you if you asked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.34a;Yes, I'll ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCLASSGAIN.34;You send a message to [class_gethelp.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.34b;No, I'd rather do this myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.35;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetBestName],\n\nI am studying to become like yourself and would be honoured if you were to teach me some of what you know.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.35a;Very well, I shall teach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCLASSGAIN.35;[From.GetBestName] receives your answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.35b;No, go bother someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.36;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetBestName],\n\nI accept your request, and shall help you in your goal.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.37;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetBestName],\n\nI will not waste my time helping you.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.38;As a mage, you must choose a school of magic in which to specialise in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.38a;The School of Abjuration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.38b;The School of Enchantment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.38c;The School of Illusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.39a;The School of Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.39b;The School of Transmutation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.39c;The School of Conjuration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.40a;The School of Evocation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.40b;The School of Blood Magic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.41;The school of abjuration focuses on defensive spells, be it on the mage or on others. While lacking in offensive power, those who follow the path of abjuration can survive what few others can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.41a;I shall choose this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.42;The school of enchantment focuses on imbuing various items with magical power instead of casting spells. Enchanters are capable of creating both marvellous magical items and constructs to do their bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.43;The school of illusion works indirectly, by creating various phantasmal images and sounds to confuse, frighten or amaze any who gaze upon them. Alternatively, illusionists can also use their magic to conceal a person or object from hostile eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.44;The school of divination deals with scrying information about past, future and present through magical means. Diviners can see what is happening a continent away, or even get premonitions of things yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.45;The school of transmutation is versatile, concerning itself with altering a being or object's properties. Those adept at transmutation can also control time to an extent, or teleport themselves and others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.46;The school of conjuration allows a mage to summon forth beings, and sometimes objects, from other planes and worlds. These mages must be careful though, for that which they brought forth may not necessarily obey them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.47;The school of evocation encompasses all kinds of offensive magics, allowing a mage to wreak havoc amongst their opponents and bring down fortifications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.48;The sinister and forbidden school of blood magic is frowned upon by most mages and societies, for it involves using blood, either the mage's or another's, as a catalyst for devastating magical spells can wither away life and enslave minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.48b;I shall practice this in secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.49;As a priest, you must choose which type of divine magic you shall use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.49a;Holy Priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.49b;Shadow Priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.49c;Lunar Priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.49d;Solar Priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.49e;Sea Witch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.50;Holy magic originates from the Light, and those who wield it can use it to heal, or to destroy both demons and undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.51;Shadow magic originates from the Void, and damages, corrupts, and taints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.52;Lunar magic originates from Elune, and those who wield it can draw upon a versatile array of powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.53;Solar magic originates from the Sun, and those who wield it can draw upon various offensive powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.54;Sea witches bend the power of the elements, particularly those of water and air, to aid them in carrying out the will of their queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.55;As a shaman, you must choose whether to focus on mastering the four normal elements, the element of spirit, or the element of decay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.55a;Air, Fire, Earth, and Water;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.55b;Spirit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.55c;Decay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.56;Elementalists bind or make deals with the elemental being of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water for power, service, or other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.57;Spiritualists tap into the world's fifth element: Spirit. It is an inner energy present within all living beings, and brings balance to the other elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.58;"Dark shamans harness the so-called ""sixth element"", Decay, to enslave elementals into servitude, or to weaponize them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.59;As a druid, you must choose an aspect of nature in which to focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.59a;Moon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.59b;Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.59c;Growth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.59d;Beasts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.60a;Druids who focus on the moon draw upon the power of the goddess Elune to defend nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.60b;Druids who focus on the moon draw upon the power of the Earthmother's left eye, Mu'sha, to guide their kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.61;Druids who focus on the sun draw upon the power of the Earthmother's right eye, An'she, to guide their kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.62;Menders are druids who use the power of nature to heal and encourage growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.63;Those called feral druids are druids who opt to take the forms of animals in order to better commune with nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.64;As a witch doctor, you must choose an aspect of your craft in which to focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.64a;Hexes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.64b;Brews;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.64c;Shadow Hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.65;Hexers are witch doctors who specialize in casting curses onto others, as well as draining their life-force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.66;Witch doctors focusing on brews can mix various concoctions that cause a variety of effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.67;Shadow hunters are a special cadre of trolls who use their loa-granted powers to strike from the shadows as skirmishers and assassins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.69a;I'll just keep it to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.69b;I must bring this to light!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.70;Though [From.GetBestName] has discovered your illicit training, [From.GetSheHe] decided to keep that information to [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLASSGAIN.70;I am glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCLASSGAIN.71;Disaster! Not only [From.GetBestName] has discovered your illicit training, [From.GetSheHe] decided to tell everyone about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
