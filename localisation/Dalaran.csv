EVTDESCDALARAN.2;Lately, the city of Dalaran has been attracting more and more magicians, lured in by the hopes of a society where they are free to exert their powers freely amongst their peers, without being subject to suspicion from those unaccustomed to the arcane. This great concentration of spellcasters has resulted in the city's government being replaced by a magocracy, the Council of Six.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDALARAN.3;It is brought to your attention that there are still vacant seats in the Council of Six. Dalaran cannot be administered properly without them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDALARAN.3a;Very well, give me some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDALARAN.3b;I don't care who fills these positions, just handle it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDALARAN.4;Due to taking too long to fulfil your promise to fill the Council of Six's vacant seats, the mages of Dalaran have organized and voted on representatives to take those seats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDALARAN.6;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I feel like I should aid in carrying the burden that is administering our realm, and, as such, I ask that I be granted a title that I may be able to do so.\n\nA fellow member of the Council, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDALARAN.11;[From.GetBestName] has sent by [From.GetHerHis] family to be educated in the arcane at your city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDALARAN.13;[From.GetFirstName] has returned from Dalaran, apparently having dropped out for some reason or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDALARAN.13;This is a shameful display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
