race_orc_desc;"The orcs are a prolific and physically powerful race hailing from the once-lush world of Draenor.

Rampant demonic corruption caused the orcs to be filled with bloodlust and turned their normally brown skin into shades of green, culminating with Kil'jaeden's servant Gul'dan convincing the orc chieftains to drink the blood of the demon Mannoroth and thereby enslaving them to the Burning Legion's will. The few orcs who escaped the corruption became known as mag'har (""uncorrupted"").";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
