BM_ARATHI_TROLL_WARS;The Troll Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ARATHI_TROLL_WARS_DESC;For centuries the forest trolls of the Amani Empire raided and pillaged the surrounding lands, still clinging to old hatreds from humiliations of the past.  The arrival of Zandalari emissaries, however, have whipped the Amani into a fervor, boosting their already mighty martial prowess with powerful voodoo magics and loa demigods as they launch a brutal war of reconquest against the high elves. Yet the elves and the trolls are not the only power in the Northlands: under High King Thoradin, the myriad human tribes have united under the banner of Arathor, and watch the war to their north with caution. After all, if the Amani win, they may turn their sights southwards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GURUBASHI_CIVIL_WAR;Gurubashi Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GURUBASHI_CIVIL_WAR_DESC;Deep within the jungles of Stranglethorn, Gurubashi society is in turmoil. Though widespread worship of the Loa of Blood, Hakkar, has ensured great conquests for the Gurubashi, the ever greater sacrifices that Hakkar demands are driving the Empire to the brink of ruin. Now, many trolls have risen in revolt, with the aid of far Zandalar, against the Hakkari emperor and his Atal'ai fanatics who wish to see the Blood Loa as the only god in Stranglethorn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_SEVEN_KINGDOMS;The Seven Kingdoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_SEVEN_KINGDOMS_DESC;The Arathi Empire is now merely a memory in the wake of the seven human kingdoms that have spread across the Eastern Kingdoms. But without any external foes to rally them like in the Troll Wars of ages past, the bonds of old are forgotten and new rivalries emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_LAST_ANVILMAR_KING;The Last Anvilmar King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_LAST_ANVILMAR_KING_DESC;Though prosperous through the loose partnerships with the northern humans and the decline of the ice trolls of Dun Morogh, dwarven society simmers with tension. For generations, the clans Bronzebeard, Wildhammer and Dark Iron have been feuding with each other, and, as King Modimus Anvilmar grows closer to his death, violence between the clans over control of Ironforge seem inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_THREE_HAMMERS;The Three Hammers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_THREE_HAMMERS_DESC;The brutal civil war that shattered the dwarven kingdom may be over, and clan Bronzebeard may hold Ironforge, but hostilities still simmer. Both the Wildhammers at Grim Batol and the Dark Irons at Thaurissan still resent the Bronzebeards for exiling them from the heart of Khaz Modan. And from the embers of that resentment, the fires of a new war may once again blaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GNOLL_WAR;Gnoll War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GNOLL_WAR_DESC;Usually considered to be little more than monsters and doomed to live in obscurity at the wild edges of civilization, the gnolls of the Redridge Mountains have united into a pack of never-before seen size under the might of Packlord Garfang, and now seek to ravage and destroy Stormwind and reclaim the fertile lands of the south for the packs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WRATH_OF_THE_GURUBASHI;Wrath of the Gurubashi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WRATH_OF_THE_GURUBASHI_DESC;In an attempt to stop jungle troll raids on Westfall, the young prince Llane Wrynn of Stormwind led a small team of his friends deep into Zul'Gurub itself to assassinate the troll leader Jok'non. Though they succeeded, it sparked the wrath of the tribes who have rallied under Zan'non, Jok'non's son, who now marches to Stormwind empowered with the might of the Soulflayer himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FALL_OF_STORMWIND;The Fall of Stormwind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FALL_OF_STORMWIND_DESC;The Guardian Medivh, corrupted by the Dark Titan Sargeras, has opened a portal at the southernmost end of the Eastern Kingdoms leading to the world of Draenor. There, the orcish Horde, under the dual command of warchief Blackhand the Destroyer and the warlock Gul'dan, prepares to march onto the unsuspecting human kingdom of Stormwind in a war of a scale unseen since the Sundering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TIDES_OF_DARKNESS;Tides of Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TIDES_OF_DARKNESS_DESC;Stormwind is no more and the Horde is triumphant, and yet, in their victory, the orcs are more fragile than ever as clans vie for dominance. Blackhand is dead at the hands of Doomhammer, now warchief himself, and the great warlock Gul'dan fell into a magical coma shortly before the Horde's victory. As Orgrim Doomhammer purges the Horde of all demonic influences, the few survivors of the Shadow Council present him with an alternative to replace the Horde's magical might: the death magic of necromancy. Now Doomhammer's ambition drives the orcs northwards, where they may find new allies, and an unified enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LORD_OF_THE_CLANS;Lord of the Clans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LORD_OF_THE_CLANS_DESC;It's been ten years since the destruction of Draenor at the hands of Ner'zhul. The Orcs have grown sluggish and placid, locked away in the intermernment camps set up by the Alliance across Hillsbrad. Yet there may be hope for the Horde as rumours of a new Warchief make their way across the land. And while the Alliance fractures and grows apart a new, death-obsessed, cult takes hold across the Northlands of Lordaeron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SCOURGE_OF_LORDAERON;Scourge of Lordaeron;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SCOURGE_OF_LORDAERON_DESC;Even as most of the Northlands' orcs mysteriously vanish, a devastating plague strikes at the very heart of Lordaeron.

BM_PATH_OF_THE_DAMNED;Path of the Damned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_PATH_OF_THE_DAMNED_DESC;Finding only death in the cold north, prince Arthas Menethil returned home and murdered his own father, paving the way for an army of the dead to sweep across the kingdom unimpeded. Now guided by whispers of the Lich King and the machinations of the dreadlord Varimathras, Arthas must herald the return of the Burning Legion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DRUMS_OF_WAR;Drums of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DRUMS_OF_WAR_DESC;Four years have passed since the fateful battle at Mount Hyjal, where Alliance and Horde came together to defeat Archimonde. Since then, the Horde has been trying to expand across central Kalimdor, seeking to forge a homeland, while their allies in the east, the Forsaken, reclaim the ruins of Lordaeron from Scourge and Crusader alike. The Alliance, meanwhile, strives to remain united despite the mysterious disappearance of their leader, King Varian Wrynn. In these convoluted times, adventurers set forth, heeding the call of glory and plunder, old hatreds come to surface, and threats long forgotten stir from their slumber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_HUNT_FOR_THE_BETRAYER_DESC;In the aftermath of the Third War, the Betrayer Illidan has allied with the Naga in his quest to destroy the Lich King and the Scourge. Meanwhile, in the ruins of Lordaeron, King Arthas returns to his home only to find the scheming of dreadlords as Ner'zhul's power over the Scourge falters. And amongst these events, the Alliance falters and chafes under the leadership of its bigoted Grand Marshal, who is particularly hostile to the struggling survivos of Quel'Thalas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
